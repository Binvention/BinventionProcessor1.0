# BinventionProcessor1.0
 My own implimentation of a basic pipelined processor

This is currently a work in progress. The functionality is as follows.

Basic Single Instruction Single Stage Processor is working fully.
Golden Code for the Basic Processor is working fully.
Pipelined processor is not yet complete
Assembler is not yet complete.

Compiler -- this will be a C++ based assembler that will take the assembly code and create a binary file for execution
Golden Code -- this will be a C++ based simulator that should perform the same function as the processor in order to validate performance
VerilogCode -- this will be the verilog code for the processor I have currently created some modules but my first iteration is not yet complete. 

I will add additional files as needed to keep track of instruction set architecture as well as other aspects of the processor. 

I intend to use this as a platform to experiment with computer architecture and design concepts without being dependent on licensed works or restricted by current implimentations of communication or architecture (although I will probably add compatability with some protocols later as well as impliment modern architecture considerations).
